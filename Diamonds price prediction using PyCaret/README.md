This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 31,000 diamonds Your goal is to predict the price of the diamonds.

Content

Price(target): price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

Carat: weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

Cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

Clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x: length in mm (0--10.74)

y: width in mm (0--58.9)

z: depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95) The width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter
